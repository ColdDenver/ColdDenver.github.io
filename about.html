                <p class="indent para">To find the meaning of “Cold” is to look at the word alone and think of how versatile it really is. “Cold” is a true homonym, meaning a word spelled and pronounced the same but with multiple meanings. Denver is a cold city, especially in the winter, but all the people are very warm. On the other hand there are plenty of warm cities populated by cold and distant people.</p>
                <p class="para">So there it is, Cold can be experienced everywhere and by anyone. It can be a lack of emotional interest or an actual physical shiver when the temperature goes down.  Here is to hoping it’s one or the other and not both, but knowing our luck it will be.</p>
                <p class="para">Denver was an easy choice of where to locate Cold for multiple reasons; the first being that Denver is always associated with cold mountain sports such as skiing or snowboarding. The other is that most of the crew was raised in Denver for a portion of their life. Compare Denver to any place and at the end of the day; there is nothing like it. Cold could have been another brand located in Los Angeles or New York easily enough, but Denver has a lifestyle and culture that cannot be replaced.</p>
                <p class="para">As Cold progresses, there will be many different locations and people who contribute to the brand. In a more global world, physical location of work matters less. The main crew is about eight people for now that span across the United States in five states currently. The collaboration and work all gets done across the United States and will show the brand’s different viewpoints and styles stemming from our diverse crew.</p>
                <p class="para">Cold is a very versatile word and brand. The “Cold” brand and crew are continuing to work hard to provide the most thought out products for ourselves and our customers.</p>
